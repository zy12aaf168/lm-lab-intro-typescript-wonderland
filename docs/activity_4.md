# Activity 4 - The Queen's Croquet

## Generics

In Wonderland, croquet is played by using a flamingo to push a hedgehog through an arch made of playing cards.

👉 Read `4_croquet.ts`

Notice the generic `Croquet<TBall,TMallet>` interface which operates on two generic types, one for the ball and one for the mallet. The `hit` function defined on the interface uses those types so it knows what is hitting what.

However, the Queen of Hearts hasn't set any limits on those generic types, which means we can use ANYTHING as a mallet or ball. In our particular instance of the `Croquet` interface, we are currently using `number`, which doesn't seem right...

💡 Before we start, also notice that within the `hit` function we are checking for `string` types. Our custom `Ball` and `Mallet` types _don't actually exist at runtime_ - only when we're writing the code.

⚠️ If you are used to languages like C# and Java this can be a bit surprising, as you might expect to be able to use `typeof Ball` in TypeScript - but `Ball` doesn't exist when the code comes to run, as TypeScript transpiles down to JavaScript.

Bearing that in mind, let's pass the Queen's Croquet challenge!

# FIXME

Currently, the `Croquet<TBall,TMallet>` interface is taking `<number, number>` rather than using our custom types for ball and mallet.

👉 At the first FIXME, we want to restrict the generic type in our interface. This is done using the `extends` keyword.

Change:

```TypeScript
interface Croquet<TBall, TMallet> {
	hit: (ball: TBall, mallet: TMallet) => boolean;
}
```

to:

```TypeScript
interface Croquet<TBall extends Ball, TMallet extends Mallet> {
	hit: (ball: TBall, mallet: TMallet) => boolean;
}
```

💡 `extends` adds a restriction to a generic type, saying that the type must inherit in some way from our specified type.

This is great! We want our ball to be a `Ball` and mallet to be a `Mallet`.

👉 Notice that this immediately breaks the FIXME below - the numbers we were passing in are no longer valid as they don't inherit from either `Ball` or `Mallet`.

👉 Change `<number, number>` to use the provided custom types `<Ball, Mallet>`

👉 The final FIXME: Thanks to our generic type restrictions, TypeScript now knows that the number parameters we were passing in before are not valid balls or mallets.

👉 Try passing in different strings and notice that TypeScript will only allow you to pass in a valid ball or mallet.

👉 If we use the correct ball and mallet then we'll succeed at the particular game we're playing:

```JavaScript
game.hit("Hedgehog", "Flamingo")
```

🥳 These changes are enough to pass by the croquet challenge.

# Lessons to take from this chapter:

💡 Our custom `Ball` and `Mallet` types use the `|` operator to combine types. `|` means 'or', so the ball can be a "Hedgehog" or a "Cricket ball", etc.

💡 We can use generics to make functions that can be called only with certain types. The type of the parameter in `hit` changes when you alter the interface.

💡 Familiarity with generic syntax.

💡 The custom types `Ball` and `Mallet` are really strings when the code is running.

Unfortunately, following our croquet victory, it's time to stand trial for theft in [activity 5](./activity_5.md).
